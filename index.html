        <h1>Hi!</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>My interest in books helps me create wonderful pieces of writing. I love to write opinions and narratives most because I find it easier than informational, though I like those to. <br> Sometimes after school, I like to read a book and write something else based of it like alternative ending. I love to write as you can tell, but I absolutely hate poetry. The time I have a imaginnation is when I writing, otherwise I can't even think of a name to name something.</p>
